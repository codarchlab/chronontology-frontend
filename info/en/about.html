            <h1>About iDAI.chronontology</h1>

            <p>
iDAI.chronontology (short form: chronOntology) is a web service 
that connects chronological terms with dating information. 
An internet research tool mainly for the Archaeology and Altertumswissenschaft, 
ChronOntology is part of the iDAI.welt and the period terms gazetteer of the German Archaeological Institute (DAI).
Similarly to the 
<a href="https://gazetteer.dainst.org">iDAI.gazetteer</a>, 
it serves as a standard data vocabulary for other information systems of the DAI 
and links them with other global time gazetteer systems. 
In addition, anyone can refer to the data in chronOntology
and on request add additional project-specific or research-specific data. 
            </p>
            <p>
The chronOntology project was funded from 2015 to 2018 by the German Research Foundation (DFG). 
The long-term availability of the data is guaranteed by the DAI within the scope of the iDAI.welt.
